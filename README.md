# NLP
This is done in 2 stages :
a) Data Pre-processing - Tokenizatoin, Stop words removal, Stemming, Lemmatization
b) Modedlling Techniques- Bag of word, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings, Sentiment Analysis

Libraries used - Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, Spacy

Data Preprocessing: Remove or fill null values, Count unique values in the column, Drop the irrelevant columns

Tokenization:
It is a method used to split a phrase, sentence, paragraph, or an entire text document into smaller units. BY doing we can get the indovidual words or terms. Each of these smaller units are called tokens

Stemming:
It is the way to reduce a word to its word stem that affixes and prefixes.In simple term, this algorithms work by cutting off the end or the beginning of the word while taking into account a list of common prefixes and suffixes that can be found in an inflected word.

Lemmatization:
It helps to do the morphological analysis of the words.It is important to have the knowledge about the detailed dictionaries which the algorithm can refer to link the form to its lemmain

Stop words:
Words that adds extra weight to the sentence. like he,she,her,yourself.These are removed inorder to make the data dense

Bag of words:
Used to preprocess the text or documentation

TF-IDF: Means Term Frequqncy and inverse Documentary Frequency.This helps to measure the score in order to get information retrieval or summarisarion.TF-IDF is also used to reflect hpw relevant a term is in a given document

Word embedding:
vectors are one of the most common way to encode words as vectors of numbers those vectors can br fed into the machine learning models for inference and also it helps to establish the distance between two tokens 
types : word2vec, glove, fastText

Machine learning:
subset of Ai that allows the system to automatically learn and improve from experience withput being explicity

Lifecycle of Machine Learning: Understand the business problem


Sentiment analysis:
It is a technique which is a technique commonly used to understand the positive , negative or neutral sentiment about a particular topic
